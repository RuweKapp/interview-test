frontend:
<ol>
  <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">create new service called 'api'</li>
  <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">add 1 method to service to get the contacts from the api located at 'http://localhost:4201/heroes'</li>
  <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">create new component named 'list'</li>
  <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">in the component, add the api service and get the list of contacts.</li>
  <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">display the list on the frontend.</li>
  <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">There should be a heading (h2) with the title 'Tour of Heroes'.</li>
</ol>

Lack of using angular, resulted in:
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p>
      when the button is clicked, it should post the hero name and action to the relevant endpoint -
      Could not figure out in time how to post the 'evolve' command to reflect the new data in the table.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>
     Font-weight does not want to change, did not continue with this, for the sake if time.
   </p>
  </li>
</ol>

End result:
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p>
        FrontEnd can receive and display data from the C# API.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>
        Implemented api service, and list component.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p>
        Background and foreground color can randomize on each row, did not create a randomizer for each CSS class (Time constraint).
   </p>
  </li>
</ol>
